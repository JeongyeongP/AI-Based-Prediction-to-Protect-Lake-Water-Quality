# AI-Based-Prediction-to-Protect-Lake-Water-Quality
### AI-Based Prediction to Protect Lake Water Quality Project

This project was the first stage of Summer Research Fellowship.
From Jinji lake, massive values corresponding to these 16 variables: longitude, latitude, Time, chlorophyll, electrical conductivity, Low Frequency Water Depth(m), Dissolved Oxygen (% Sat), Dissolved oxygen (mg/L), Ammonia nitrogen, salinity, Phycotin, Total dissolved solids, turbidity, temperature, Ph value, and PH value (mv) were obtained. 
In this mini research, variables which are most related to Phycotin are indicated. The relationship is identified with a model and Phycotin can be predicted with it. The quality/performance of a model are also evaluated.

### How To Run

When the code is run, the system will ask:
  Please choose a model
  Type 'MLR' for Multiple Linear Regression
  Type 'DT' for Decision Trees
  ->
A user can choose which model one wants to use by typing 'MLR' or 'DT'
